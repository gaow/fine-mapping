# Do not edit!

Scripts under this folder are automatically exported from `../finemapping.ipynb`. 
Do not edit these scripts. Edit the notebook instead.

If there are command executable tools involved in the benchmark,
you should put them under either `linux` or `mac` folder under this directory,
then use them in your benchmarking script as if they are available from your
system `PATH`.
